## Features
1. Easy setup: simply setup a MongoDB connection, a Mailgun account, and a Node.js instance, and you're ready to roll.
1. Email verification: Snaps are authenticated via emails, thus less spamming opportunities (is that a good thing?).
1. Rate limited: Email sending is rate limited and easily configurable, so you won't run out of Mailgun credits too fast.
1. No Data Racing: MongoDB comes with a number of measures including locking and other concurrency control to ensure no data racing happens.

## Development

1. Make sure [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) is installed.
1. Create a directory for the development database: `mkdir db`
1. Set up environment variables in `.env` (* - not required if running on Heroku)
    * `PORT`*: Port number to run it on; not required if running on Heroku
    * `HOST`: Domain that the app is being hosted on, for email link generation
    * `MONGODB_URI`*: MongoDB Connection String
    * `SALT`: Random string, used to generate validation keys
